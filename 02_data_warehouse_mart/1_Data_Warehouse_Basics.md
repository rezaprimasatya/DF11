## Module 1: What is a Data Warehouse?

### 1.1 What is a Data Warehouse?

A data warehouse is a centralized repository that stores large volumes of data from various sources in a structured and organized manner. It is designed to support business intelligence (BI) and analytical reporting activities. Data warehouses are essential for businesses to make informed decisions, as they provide a historical perspective on data and enable complex querying and reporting.

### 1.2 Knowing the What and Why

Data warehouses exist to:

- **Store Data**: They store data from different sources, such as transactional databases, logs, and external data, into a single, consolidated location.
  
- **Enable Analysis**: Data warehouses enable businesses to perform complex analysis and generate insights from historical data.

- **Support Decision-Making**: They help organizations make data-driven decisions, leading to improved efficiency and competitiveness.

## Module 2: Data Warehouses vs. Data Lakes

### 2.1 Data Warehouses vs. Data Lakes

Data lakes are another common concept in the world of data management. Let's understand the key differences between data warehouses and data lakes.

- **Data Warehouses**:
  - Structured Data: Data is stored in structured tables with predefined schemas.
  - Optimized for Analytics: Designed for analytical queries and reporting.
  - Schema-On-Write: Data is structured before ingestion.
  
- **Data Lakes**:
  - Flexible Schema: Data can be stored in its raw, unstructured form.
  - Supports All Data Types: Can handle structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
  - Schema-On-Read: Schema is applied when data is queried.

### 2.2 Data Warehouses vs. Data Marts

Data marts are subsets of data warehouses that are designed for specific business units or departments. Let's compare the two:

- **Data Warehouses**:
  - Centralized: Serve the entire organization.
  - Comprehensive: Contain data from all aspects of the business.
  - Longer Development Time: Take time to build and maintain.
  
- **Data Marts**:
  - Decentralized: Tailored for specific business units.
  - Focused: Contain data relevant to a particular department.
  - Faster Development: Quick to set up as they address specific needs.

## Module 3: Deciding Between a Data Lake, Warehouse, and Mart

### 3.1 Deciding Between Data Lake, Warehouse, and Mart

Choosing between a data lake, data warehouse, or data mart depends on your organization's needs. Consider:

- **Data Volume**: Data lakes handle large volumes of raw data, while data warehouses and marts focus on structured, processed data.

- **Query Complexity**: If you need complex querying and reporting capabilities, a data warehouse or mart is preferable.

- **Scalability**: Data lakes are highly scalable, while data warehouses and marts may have limitations.

## Module 4: Data Warehouses Support Organizational Analysis

### 4.1 Data Warehouses Support Organizational Analysis

Data warehouses serve as the foundation for various analytical tasks within an organization. Examples include:

- **Sales Analysis**: Tracking sales performance, trends, and customer behavior.
- **Financial Analysis**: Analyzing financial data for forecasting and compliance.
- **Marketing Analytics**: Measuring the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.
- **Inventory Management**: Optimizing inventory levels and supply chains.

## Module 5: Data Warehouse Life Cycle

### 5.1 Data Warehouse Life Cycle

The data warehouse life cycle involves several stages:

- **Data Ingestion**: Collecting data from various sources and loading it into the warehouse.
- **Data Transformation**: Cleaning, transforming, and structuring the data.
- **Data Storage**: Storing data efficiently for fast querying.
- **Data Access**: Enabling users to query and extract insights.
- **Data Maintenance**: Regularly updating and maintaining the warehouse.

## Example Using BigQuery Public Dataset

Now, let's put theory into practice with an example using Google BigQuery's public dataset. We'll explore a dataset, perform some basic queries, and understand how data warehousing tools like BigQuery can help you analyze data effectively.

```sql
-- Query to find the total sales by product category from a public dataset
SELECT
  product_category,
  SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.samples.natality`
GROUP BY
  product_category
ORDER BY
  total_sales DESC;
