# Analytics Engineer

Analytics Engineer is a relatively new and emerging position in the field of data analytics. Analytics Engineers play a crucial role in helping organizations make data-driven decisions by designing and maintaining the data infrastructure that supports analytics and reporting.

## Main Job Desk
The role of an Analytics Engineer is critical in ensuring that data is collected, processed, and made available for analysis in a reliable and efficient manner. They bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights, playing a vital role in data-driven decision-making within organizations.

## Responsible
Data Pipeline Development: Designing, building, and maintaining data pipelines that extract data from various sources, transform it into a usable format, and load it into data storage or analytical systems.

* Data Modeling: Creating data models that represent the structure of data, making it easier for analysts and data scientists to query and analyze information.

* ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): Developing ETL processes to clean, transform, and enrich raw data, ensuring data quality and consistency.

* Database Management: Managing databases and data warehouses, optimizing data storage, and ensuring data security, integrity, and availability.

* Query Optimization: Writing and optimizing SQL queries to retrieve data efficiently, especially in the context of large datasets.

* Integration with Analytics Tools: Integrating data pipelines with analytics and reporting tools, such as business intelligence (BI) platforms or data visualization tools.

* Collaboration with Data Analysts and Data Scientists: Working closely with data analysts and data scientists to understand their data requirements and providing them with the data they need for analysis and modeling.

* Automation: Automating data processes and workflows to reduce manual intervention and increase efficiency.

* Data Governance and Compliance: Ensuring that data is managed in compliance with data privacy regulations and organizational data governance policies.

* Performance Monitoring: Monitoring data pipelines and databases to identify and address performance issues and bottlenecks.

* Documentation: Maintaining documentation for data pipelines, data models, and processes to facilitate knowledge sharing and troubleshooting.

* Troubleshooting and Issue Resolution: Diagnosing and resolving data-related issues and errors in a timely manner.

* Scalability and Optimization: Planning for the scalability of data infrastructure to handle growing data volumes and optimizing data processing for cost-efficiency.

* Data Security: Implementing security measures to protect sensitive data and ensure data access is limited to authorized users.

* Continuous Learning: Staying up-to-date with the latest data engineering technologies and best practices to enhance skills and improve data infrastructure.

* Communication: Effectively communicating technical concepts and solutions to non-technical stakeholders, such as business managers and executives.

## Different roles on modern data teams in larger organizations

## 5 key techniques
Analytics teams can adopt from software engineering teams.

### 1. Analytics code should be version controlled #
- The Before Times: Chaos! Analysts, engineers and data scientists saved queries to their personal machines, or at best checked them into a repository as a stored procedure. When the pipeline broke, analysts looked to the data engineers and vice versa, without anyone being sure of what code change broke the pipeline.

- Today: Data people (analysts, analytics engineers, data engineers, data scientists) collaborate on analytics code in a shared git repository. We review each other’s code changes, and test them for quality before merging into production. No one can remember why we ever used to store our precious queries in a DO_NOT_DELETE folder on our desktop.

### 2. Analytics code should have quality assurance #
- The Before Times: Data teams were always on defense, reacting to issues in the data pipeline. Spot checks happened here and there, but we lacked programmatic testing of data transformations.

- Today: Thousands of teams are bulking up their data transformation projects with dbt tests, breaking the cycle of reactivity that can plague our work with data. Catching bugs before they hit production means fewer hotfixes, more reliability, and more trust in your numbers.

### 3. Analytics code should be modular #
- The Before Times: Analysts live in their own siloes. How did she formulate that metric? How did they filter that dataset? Each new spreadsheet or report starts with running the same queries and copying the same spreadsheet formulas. Everyone mutters why it’s so hard to share code.

- Today: Analysts, data engineers and data scientists collaborate on a unified code base, where the work of each person can build directly on the work of others. One model can serve as the basis to several. Template languages like Jinja help teams write more modular SQL. Less boilerplate work means more time to tackle big problems.

### 4. Analytics should use environments #
- The Before Times: Many teams were running hot, testing in production. Crossing fingers that the daily marketing attribution report isn’t going to break on this next hotfix.

- Today: Teams develop, test, and review changes or additions in a development environment. See the results of changes before committing to production. You know, like software.

### 5. Analytics code should be designed for maintainability #
- The Before Times: New data routinely breaks existing data models, without so much as an alert. When things do break down, teams have limited visibility across the stack to isolate the issue.

- Today: By practicing modular data modeling, teams isolate the risk of changing source data to the single, individual model that ingests that data. When that schema changes down the road, teams must only make one update, which automatically propagates downstream to the rest of the pipeline.
